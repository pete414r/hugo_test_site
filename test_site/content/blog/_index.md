A Hollywood-funded film version, produced and filmed in the UK, was released in April 2005, and radio adaptations of the third, fourth, and fifth novels were broadcast from 2004 to 2005.

Adams did many of these adaptations, including the novels, the TV series, the computer game, and the earliest drafts of the Hollywood filmâ€™s screenplay, and some of the stage shows introduced new material written by Adams.
